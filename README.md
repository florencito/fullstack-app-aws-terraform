# AWS Terraform Flask App

This project provisions a small AWS environment using Terraform:

- An EC2 instance that runs the Flask API inside a Docker container.
- An RDS MySQL database instance.
- Security groups allowing the instance to reach the database.

## ðŸ§± Technologies

- **Terraform**
- **AWS (EC2, RDS, VPC, Security Groups)**
- **Flask**
- **Python 3**
- **Docker**
- **GitHub Actions**

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                   # Flask app code
â”œâ”€â”€ db/                    # Database init script and Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ infra/                 # Terraform code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ terraform.tfvars   # generated by GitHub Actions or created manually
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ outputs.tf
â””â”€â”€ .github/workflows/     # Terraform CI workflows
```

The `infra/main.tf` file defines an **S3 backend** so the Terraform state can be
shared when running the GitHub Actions workflows. If you plan on using these
workflows, create the S3 bucket referenced there. Otherwise, remove the backend
block so Terraform stores the state locally.

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the `infra/` directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-user/aws-terraform-flask-app.git
   cd aws-terraform-flask-app/infra
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

   If you are not using GitHub Actions, create a `terraform.tfvars` file in this
   directory with your `db_username`, `db_password` and `public_key` values
   before running the next commands.

3. Preview the changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Apply the infrastructure. Provide your SSH **public key** along with the
   database credentials:
   ```bash
   terraform apply \
     -var="public_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/flask-key.pub)" \
     -var="db_username=<user>" \
     -var="db_password=<password>"
   ```

5. Once the infrastructure is deployed, copy the EC2 public IP and open it in your browser:
   ```
   http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:5000
   ```

### Deploy via GitHub Actions

The repository provides workflows under `.github/workflows/` that can apply or
destroy the infrastructure. Configure the following secrets in your repository
before triggering them:

- `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` â€“ AWS credentials
- `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` â€“ credentials for the RDS instance
- `PUBLIC_KEY` â€“ contents of the SSH public key for the EC2 instance

## ðŸ“„ API Endpoints

- `/` â†’ "Hola desde Flask en EC2!"
- `/inventario` â†’ Returns a JSON list of items.

- The EC2 instance clones this repository, builds the Docker image and runs the
  Flask app automatically.
- The key pair used for SSH access is created from the `PUBLIC_KEY` value, which
  can be stored as a GitHub secret.

## ðŸ§¹ To Destroy

When you're done, destroy the infrastructure:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
